## 1. Configuration Metadata

### 1.1 XML-based configuration

XML-based configuration metadata configures these beans as `<bean/>` elements inside a top-level `<beans/>` element.

### 1.2 Annotation-based configuration

Spring 2.5 introduced support for annotation-based configuration metadata.

### 1.3 Java-based configuration

Java configuration typically uses `@Bean`-annotated methods within a `@Configuration` class.

## 2. Container extension points

### 2.1 Customizing beans using `BeanPostProcessors`

The `BeanPostProcessor` interface defines callback methods that you can implement to provide your own (or override the containerâ€™s default) instantiation logic, dependency resolution logic, and so forth. If you want to implement some custom logic after the Spring container finishes instantiating, configuring, and initializing a bean, you can plug in one or more custom `BeanPostProcessor` implementations.

You can configure multiple `BeanPostProcessor` instances, and you can control the order in which these `BeanPostProcessor` instances run by setting the `order` property. You can set this property only if the `BeanPostProcessor` implements the `Ordered` interface. If you write your own `BeanPostProcessor`, you should consider implementing the `Ordered` interface, too. For further details, see the javadoc of the [`BeanPostProcessor`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.2.16.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/BeanPostProcessor.html) and [`Ordered`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.2.16.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/Ordered.html) interfaces. 

### 2.2 Customizing configuration metadata with `BeanFactoryPostProcessors`

The next extension point that we look at is the `org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanFactoryPostProcessor`. The semantics of this interface are similar to those of the `BeanPostProcessor`, with one major difference: `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` operates on the bean configuration metadata. That is, the Spring IoC container lets a `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` read the configuration metadata and potentially change it *before* the container instantiates any beans other than `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` instances.

You can configure multiple `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` instances, and you can control the order in which these `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` instances run by setting the `order` property. However, you can only set this property if the `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` implements the `Ordered` interface. If you write your own `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`, you should consider implementing the `Ordered` interface, too. See the javadoc of the [`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.2.16.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/BeanFactoryPostProcessor.html) and [`Ordered`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.2.16.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/Ordered.html) interfaces for more details.
